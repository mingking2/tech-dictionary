### Step 1: Crystallize the problem you are solving
* Description: What is it?
    + **Breif** description of my thinking.
* Problem: What problem is this solving?
    - What do I belive the problem I am solving is, and why?
    - Strong problem statement include:
    1. **It's short.** The longer explanation, the less clear problem definition.
    2. **It's focused.** Single clear problem(due to the time limit). Including some examples of what problem I am *not* solving could be helpful.
    3. **It references a "need" that is not being fulfilled.** User need + Biz need(unnecessary). [Jobs-To-Be-Done framework](https://jtbd.info/2-what-is-jobs-to-be-done-jtbd-796b82081cca)
    4. **It includes a what and a why.** What's going wrong, and wht is it a problem?
    5. **It's agnostic of a solution.** Try not to rush for problem solving.

    - Examples of good problem statements:
    1. Lyft drivers are cancelling rides too often because the passengers are too far away.
    2. Airbnb hosts are feeling frustrated because they want to improve, but are finding it difficult to figure out how.
    3. Users are dropping off at too high a rate at the final step of the signup flow.

* Why: How do we know this is a real problem and worth solving?
* Success: How do we know if we’ve solved this problem?
* Audience: Who are we building for?
* What: What does this look like in the product?
